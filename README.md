*This is the project of SOEN 341 (Software Project). It is a procurement system website where users can purchase items from suppliers. Both users and supervisors can sign-up/log-in to their accounts to be able to serve one another. When users request for quotation, if the quotation is less than 5000, the user will choose the supplier they want and the quotation will be automatically approved. Otherwise, the supervisor will choose the supplier and accept/reject the purchase. Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL. *
